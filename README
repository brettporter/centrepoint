Before building Centrepoint, you need the license resources built (as there
is no repository to distribute them from at present):

 cd license-resources
 mvn clean install


To build and use the Centrepoint application:

 cd centrepoint
 mvn clean install

After a successful build, the file:
 distribution/target/centrepoint-1.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.zip
contains the full standalone application.

To run, unzip it and run the following command:

 bin/centrepoint console

The application can then be viewed on http://localhost:8080/
